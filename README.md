T-Shirt Review Sentiment Classifier

This project is a Sentiment Analysis Web Application built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, deployed with Streamlit.
It classifies T-shirt reviews into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments along with class probabilities.

The application uses a TF-IDF Vectorizer and a trained Machine Learning model to predict sentiment from user-entered text.
